#' @title Create a cooccurence data.frame
#' @description A cooccurence data.frame indicates how many times each term co-occurs with another term.\cr
#' 
#' There are 3 types of cooccurrences:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Looking at which words are located in the same document/sentence/paragraph.
#'   \item Looking at which words are followed by another word
#'   \item Looking at which words are in the neighbourhood of the word as in follows the word within \code{skipgram} number of words
#' }
#' The output of the function gives a cooccurrence data.frame which contains the fields term1, term2 and cooc where cooc indicates how many times
#' term1 and term2 co-occurred. This dataset can be constructed 
#' \itemize{
#'   \item based upon a data frame where you look within a group (column of the data.frame) if 2 terms occurred in that group.
#'   \item based upon a vector of words in which case we look how many times each word is followed by another word.
#'   \item based upon a vector of words in which case we look how many times each word is followed by another word or is followed by another word if we skip a number of words in between.
#' }
#' Note that 
#' \itemize{
#'   \item For cooccurrence.data.frame no ordering is assumed which implies that the function does not return self-occurrences if a word occurs several times in the same group of text and term1 is always smaller than term2 in the output
#'   \item For cooccurrence.character we assume text is ordered from left to right, the function as well returns self-occurrences
#' }
#' You can also aggregate cooccurrences if you decide to do any of these 3 by a certain group and next want to obtain an overall aggregate.
#' @param x either
#' \itemize{
#'   \item a data.frame where the data.frame contains 1 row per document/term,
#'   in which case you need to provide \code{group} and \code{term} where \code{term} is the column containing 1 term per row
#'   and \code{group} indicates something like a document id or document + sentence id. This uses cooccurrence.data.frame.
#'   \item a character vector with terms where one element contains 1 term. This uses cooccurrence.character.
#'   \item an object of class \code{cooccurrence}. This uses cooccurrence.cooccurrence.
#' }
#' @param order logical indicating if we need to sort the output from high cooccurrences to low coccurrences. Defaults to TRUE.
#' @param ... other arguments passed on to the methods
#' @return a data.frame with columns term1, term2 and cooc indicating
#' for the combination of term1 and term2 how many times this combination occurred

#' This can be used to exclude stopwords from the cooccurrence calculation or selecting only nouns and adjectives to 
#' find cooccurrences along with each other
