## udpipe universe

The udpipe package is loosely coupled with other NLP packages by the same author. Loosely coupled means that none of the packages have hard dependencies of one another making it easy to install and maintain and allowing you to use only the packages and tools that you want.

Hereby a small list of loosely coupled packages by the same author which contain functions and documentation where the udpipe package is used as a preprocessing step.
