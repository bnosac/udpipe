## CHANGES IN udpipe VERSION 0.8.9

- fix R CMD check message on Fedora clang infrastructure: rcpp_udpipe.cpp:243:8: warning: use of bitwise '&' with boolean operands

## CHANGES IN udpipe VERSION 0.8.8

- dtm_svd_similarity, fix to make sure that if provided a dtm with features which are all missing/zero, 
  the scoring still works as expected instead of removing features which contain no data whatsoever.
  So that dtm_svd_similarity can be used alongside embeddings of R package word2vec which might contain words which are not in the dtm. See the example in ?dtm_svd_similarity
- added txt_grepl
- dtm_align now uses NCOL to see if y is a vector instead of a data.frame

- Added txt_paste
- Added txt_context
- Use html_vignette instead of html_document in the vignettes in order to reduce package size

## CHANGES IN udpipe VERSION 0.8.4

- Update to UDPipe 1.2.1 (28 Sep 2018) 
    - this adds segment_size and learning_rate_final parameters to tokenizer training
    - correctly set SpaceAfter for last token when normalizing spaces.

## CHANGES IN udpipe VERSION 0.8.3

- Default of udpipe_download_model is now changed, downloads now models built on Universal Dependencies 2.4 instead of the models build on Universal Dependencies 2.3

- fix issue in udpipe_reconstruct giving wrong values in start/end positions of the token in case someone had as well SpacesBefore as SpacesAfter for a token. For users prior to version 0.8.3 you can easily circumvent this issue by removing leading/trailing white space in your text by using trimws on your text before using udpipe::udpipe.
